NAME
    Perl::Tidy::Sweetened - Tweaks to Perl::Tidy to support some syntactic
    sugar

VERSION
    version 0.25

DESCRIPTION
    There are a number of modules on CPAN that allow users to write their
    classes with a more "modern" syntax. These tools eliminate the need to
    shift off $self, can support type checking and offer other improvements.
    Unfortunately, they can break the support tools that the Perl community
    has come to rely on. This module attempts to work around those issues.

    The module uses Perl::Tidy's "prefilter" and "postfilter" hooks to
    support "method" and "func" keywords, including the (possibly
    multi-line) parameter lists. This is quite an ugly hack, but it is the
    recommended method of supporting these new keywords (see the 2010-12-17
    entry in the Perl::Tidy CHANGES
    <https://metacpan.org/source/SHANCOCK/Perl-Tidy-20120714/CHANGES> file).
    The resulting formatted code will leave the parameter lists untouched.

    "Perl::Tidy::Sweetened" attempts to support the syntax outlined in the
    following modules, but most of the new syntax styles should work:

    *   p5-mop

    *   Method::Signatures::Simple

    *   MooseX::Method::Signatures

    *   MooseX::Declare

THANKS
    The idea and much of original code taken from Jonathan Swartz' blog
    <http://www.openswartz.com/2010/12/19/perltidy-and-method-happy-together
    />.

    Kent Fredric refactored the code into the pluggable architecture. Very
    nice work, thank you.
