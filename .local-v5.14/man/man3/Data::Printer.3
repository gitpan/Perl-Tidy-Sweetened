.SH "NAME"
Data::Printer \- colored pretty\-print of Perl data structures and objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
Want to see what's inside a variable in a complete, colored
and human-friendly way?
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Printer;   # or just "use DDP" for short
\&  
\&  p @array;            # no need to pass references
.Ve
.PP
Code above might output something like this (with colors!):
.PP
.Vb 6
\&   [
\&       [0] "a",
\&       [1] "b",
\&       [2] undef,
\&       [3] "c",
\&   ]
.Ve
.PP
You can also inspect objects:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $obj = SomeClass\->new;
\&
\&    p($obj);
.Ve
.PP
Which might give you something like:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&  \e SomeClass  {
\&      Parents       Moose::Object
\&      Linear @ISA   SomeClass, Moose::Object
\&      public methods (3) : bar, foo, meta
\&      private methods (0)
\&      internals: {
\&         _something => 42,
\&      }
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Data::Printer is fully customizable. If you want to change how things
are displayed, or even its standard behavior. Take a look at the
available customizations. Once you figure out
your own preferences, create a
configuration file for
yourself and Data::Printer will automatically use it!
.PP
\&\fBThat's about it! Feel free to stop reading now and start dumping
your data structures! For more information, including feature set,
how to create filters, and general tips, just keep reading :)\fR
.PP
Oh, if you are just experimenting and/or don't want to use a
configuration file, you can set all options during initialization,
including coloring, identation and filters!
.PP
.Vb 10
\&  use Data::Printer {
\&      color => {
\&         \*(Aqregex\*(Aq => \*(Aqblue\*(Aq,
\&         \*(Aqhash\*(Aq  => \*(Aqyellow\*(Aq,
\&      },
\&      filters => {
\&         \*(AqDateTime\*(Aq => sub { $_[0]\->ymd },
\&         \*(AqSCALAR\*(Aq   => sub { "oh noes, I found a scalar! $_[0]" },
\&      },
\&  };
.Ve
.PP
The first \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR block is just syntax sugar, you can safely ommit it
if it makes things easier to read:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use DDP colored => 1;
\&
\&  use Data::Printer  deparse => 1, sort_keys => 0;
.Ve
.SH "FEATURES"
.IX Header "FEATURES"
Here's what Data::Printer has to offer to Perl developers, out of the box:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Very sane defaults (I hope!)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Highly customizable (in case you disagree with me :)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Colored output by default
.IP "\(bu" 4
Human-friendly output, with array index and custom separators
.IP "\(bu" 4
Full object dumps including methods, inheritance and internals
.IP "\(bu" 4
Exposes extra information such as tainted data and weak references
.IP "\(bu" 4
Ability to easily create filters for objects and regular structures
.IP "\(bu" 4
Ability to load settings from a \f(CW\*(C`.dataprinter\*(C'\fR file so you don't have to write anything other than \*(L"use \s-1DDP\s0;\*(R" in your code!
.SH "RATIONALE"
.IX Header "RATIONALE"
Data::Dumper is a fantastic tool, meant to stringify data structures
in a way they are suitable for being \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR'ed back in.
.PP
The thing is, a lot of people keep using it (and similar ones,
like Data::Dump) to print data structures and objects on screen
for inspection and debugging, and while you \fBcan\fR use those
modules for that, it doesn't mean mean you \fBshould\fR.
.PP
This is where Data::Printer comes in. It is meant to do one thing
and one thing only:
.PP
\&\fIdisplay Perl variables and objects on screen, properly
formatted\fR (to be inspected by a human)
.PP
If you want to serialize/store/restore Perl data structures,
this module will \s-1NOT\s0 help you. Try Storable, Data::Dumper,
\&\s-1JSON\s0, or whatever. \s-1CPAN\s0 is full of such solutions!
.SH "THE p() FUNCTION"
.IX Header "THE p() FUNCTION"
Once you load Data::Printer, the \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR function will be imported
into your namespace and available to you. It will pretty-print
into \s-1STDERR\s0 (or any other output target) whatever variabe you pass to it.
.SS "Changing output targets"
.IX Subsection "Changing output targets"
By default, \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR will be set to use \s-1STDERR\s0. As of version 0.27, you
can set up the 'output' property so Data::Printer outputs to
several different places:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`output => \*(Aqstderr\*(Aq\*(C'\fR \- Standard error. Same as *STDERR
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`output => \*(Aqstdout\*(Aq\*(C'\fR \- Standard output. Same as *STDOUT
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`output => $filename\*(C'\fR \- Appends to filename.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`output => $file_handle\*(C'\fR \- Appends to opened handle
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`output => \e$scalar\*(C'\fR \- Appends to that variable's content
.SS "Return Value"
.IX Subsection "Return Value"
If for whatever reason you want to mangle with the output string
instead of printing it, you can simply ask for a return
value:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # move to a string
\&  my $string = p @some_array;
\&
\&  # output to STDOUT instead of STDERR;
\&  print p(%some_hash);
.Ve
.PP
Note that, in this case, Data::Printer will not colorize the
returned string unless you explicitly set the \f(CW\*(C`colored\*(C'\fR option to 1:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  print p(%some_hash, colored => 1); # now with colors!
.Ve
.PP
You can \- and should \- of course, set this during you "\f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR" call:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use Data::Printer colored => 1;
\&  print p( %some_hash );  # will be colored
.Ve
.PP
Or by adding the setting to your \f(CW\*(C`.dataprinter\*(C'\fR file.
.PP
As most of Data::Printer, the return value is also configurable. You
do this by setting the \f(CW\*(C`return_value\*(C'\fR option. There are three options
available:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aqdump\*(Aq\fR (default):
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    p %var;               # prints the dump to STDERR (void context)
\&    my $string = p %var;  # returns the dump *without* printing
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aqvoid\*(Aq\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    p %var;               # prints the dump to STDERR, never returns.
\&    my $string = p %var;  # $string is undef. Data still printed in STDERR
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aqpass\*(Aq\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    p %var;               # prints the dump to STDERR, returns %var
\&    my %copy = p %var;    # %copy = %var. Data still printed in STDERR
.Ve
.SH "COLORS AND COLORIZATION"
.IX Header "COLORS AND COLORIZATION"
Below are all the available colorizations and their default values.
Note that both spellings ('color' and 'colour') will work.
.PP
.Vb 10
\&   use Data::Printer {
\&     color => {
\&        array       => \*(Aqbright_white\*(Aq,  # array index numbers
\&        number      => \*(Aqbright_blue\*(Aq,   # numbers
\&        string      => \*(Aqbright_yellow\*(Aq, # strings
\&        class       => \*(Aqbright_green\*(Aq,  # class names
\&        method      => \*(Aqbright_green\*(Aq,  # method names
\&        undef       => \*(Aqbright_red\*(Aq,    # the \*(Aqundef\*(Aq value
\&        hash        => \*(Aqmagenta\*(Aq,       # hash keys
\&        regex       => \*(Aqyellow\*(Aq,        # regular expressions
\&        code        => \*(Aqgreen\*(Aq,         # code references
\&        glob        => \*(Aqbright_cyan\*(Aq,   # globs (usually file handles)
\&        vstring     => \*(Aqbright_blue\*(Aq,   # version strings (v5.16.0, etc)
\&        repeated    => \*(Aqwhite on_red\*(Aq,  # references to seen values
\&        caller_info => \*(Aqbright_cyan\*(Aq,   # details on what\*(Aqs being printed
\&        weak        => \*(Aqcyan\*(Aq,          # weak references
\&        tainted     => \*(Aqred\*(Aq,           # tainted content
\&        escaped     => \*(Aqbright_red\*(Aq,    # escaped characters (\et, \en, etc)
\&
\&        # potential new Perl datatypes, unknown to Data::Printer
\&        unknown     => \*(Aqbright_yellow on_blue\*(Aq,
\&     },
\&   };
.Ve
.PP
Don't fancy colors? Disable them with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Printer colored => 0;
.Ve
.PP
By default, 'colored' is set to \f(CW"auto"\fR, which means Data::Printer
will colorize only when not being used to return the dump string,
nor when the output (default: \s-1STDERR\s0) is being piped. If you're not
seeing colors, try forcing it with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Printer colored => 1;
.Ve
.PP
Also worth noticing that Data::Printer \fIwill\fR honor the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED\*(C'\fR environment variable unless you force a
colored output by setting 'colored' to 1.
.PP
Remember to put your preferred settings in the \f(CW\*(C`.dataprinter\*(C'\fR file
so you never have to type them at all!
.SH "ALIASING"
.IX Header "ALIASING"
Data::Printer provides the nice, short, \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR function to dump your
data structures and objects. In case you rather use a more explicit
name, already have a \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR function (why?) in your code and want
to avoid clashing, or are just used to other function names for that
purpose, you can easily rename it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Printer alias => \*(AqDumper\*(Aq;
\&
\&  Dumper( %foo );
.Ve
.SH "CUSTOMIZATION"
.IX Header "CUSTOMIZATION"
I tried to provide sane defaults for Data::Printer, so you'll never have
to worry about anything other than typing \f(CW"p( $var )"\fR in your code.
That said, and besides coloring and filtering, there are several other
customization options available, as shown below (with default values):
.PP
.Vb 10

.PP
Note: setting \f(CW\*(C`multiline\*(C'\fR to \f(CW0\fR will also set \f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`indent\*(C'\fR to \f(CW0\fR.
.SH "FILTERS"
.IX Header "FILTERS"
Data::Printer offers you the ability to use filters to override
any kind of data display. The filters are placed on a hash,
where keys are the types \- or class names \- and values
are anonymous subs that receive two arguments: the item itself
as first parameter, and the properties hashref (in case your
filter wants to read from it). This lets you quickly override
the way Data::Printer handles and displays data types and, in
particular, objects.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  use Data::Printer filters => {
\&            \*(AqDateTime\*(Aq      => sub { $_[0]\->ymd },
\&            \*(AqHTTP::Request\*(Aq => sub { $_[0]\->uri },
\&  };
.Ve
.PP
Perl types are named as \f(CW\*(C`ref\*(C'\fR calls them: \fI\s-1SCALAR\s0\fR, \fI\s-1ARRAY\s0\fR,
\&\fI\s-1HASH\s0\fR, \fI\s-1REF\s0\fR, \fI\s-1CODE\s0\fR, \fIRegexp\fR and \fI\s-1GLOB\s0\fR. As for objects,
just use the class' name, as shown above.
.PP
As of version 0.13, you may also use the '\-class' filter, which
will be called for all non-perl types (objects).
.PP
Your filters are supposed to return a defined value (usually, the
string you want to print). If you don't, Data::Printer will
let the next filter of that same type have a go, or just fallback
to the defaults. You can also use an array reference to pass more
than one filter for the same type or class.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: If you plan on calling \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR from \fIwithin\fR an inline
filter, please make sure you are passing only \s-1REFERENCES\s0 as
arguments. See \*(L"\s-1CAVEATS\s0\*(R" below.
.PP
You may also like to specify standalone filter modules. Please
see Data::Printer::Filter for further information on a more
powerful filter interface for Data::Printer, including useful
filters that are shipped as part of this distribution.

Whenever printing the contents of a class, Data::Printer first
checks to see if that class implements a sub called '_data_printer'
(or whatever you set the \*(L"class_method\*(R" option to in your settings,
see \*(L"\s-1CUSTOMIZATION\s0\*(R" below).
.PP
If a sub with that exact name is available in the target object,
Data::Printer will use it to get the string to print instead of
making a regular class dump.
.PP
This means you could have the following in one of your classes:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  sub _data_printer {
\&      my ($self, $properties) = @_;
\&      return \*(AqHey, no peeking! But foo contains \*(Aq . $self\->foo;
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Notice you don't have to depend on Data::Printer at all, just
write your sub and it will use that to pretty-print your objects.
.PP
If you want to use colors and filter helpers, and still not
add Data::Printer to your dependencies, remember you can import
them during runtime:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  sub _data_printer {
\&      require Data::Printer::Filter;
\&      Data::Printer::Filter\->import;
\&
\&      # now we have \*(Aqindent\*(Aq, outdent\*(Aq, \*(Aqlinebreak\*(Aq, \*(Aqp\*(Aq and \*(Aqcolored\*(Aq
\&      my ($self, $properties) = @_;
\&      ...
\&  }
.Ve
.PP
Having a filter for that particular class will of course override
this setting.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE (RUN CONTROL)"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION FILE (RUN CONTROL)"
Data::Printer tries to let you easily customize as much as possible
regarding the visualization of your data structures and objects.
But we don't want you to keep repeating yourself every time you
want to use it!
.PP
To avoid this, you can simply create a file called \f(CW\*(C`.dataprinter\*(C'\fR in
your home directory (usually \f(CW\*(C`/home/username\*(C'\fR in Linux), and put
your configuration hash reference in there.
.PP
This way, instead of doing something like:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&   use Data::Printer {
\&     colour => {
\&        array => \*(Aqbright_blue\*(Aq,
\&     },
\&     filters => {
\&         \*(AqCatalyst::Request\*(Aq => sub {
\&             my $req = shift;
\&             return "Cookies: " . p($req\->cookies)
\&         },
\&     },
\&   };
.Ve
.PP
You can create a .dataprinter file that looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&   {
\&     colour => {
\&        array => \*(Aqbright_blue\*(Aq,
\&     },
\&     filters => {
\&         \*(AqCatalyst::Request\*(Aq => sub {
\&             my $req = shift;
\&             return "Cookies: " . p($req\->cookies)
\&         },
\&     },
\&   };
.Ve
.PP
Note that all we did was remove the \*(L"use Data::Printer\*(R" bit when
writing the \f(CW\*(C`.dataprinter\*(C'\fR file. From then on all you have to do
while debugging scripts is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Printer;
.Ve
.PP
and it will load your custom settings every time :)
.SS "Loading \s-1RC\s0 files in custom locations"
.IX Subsection "Loading RC files in custom locations"
If your \s-1RC\s0 file is somewhere other than \f(CW\*(C`.dataprinter\*(C'\fR in your home
dir, you can load whichever file you want via the \f(CW\*(Aqrc_file\*(Aq\fR parameter:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Printer rc_file => \*(Aq/path/to/my/rcfile.conf\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
You can even set this to undef or to a non-existing file to disable your
\&\s-1RC\s0 file at will.
.PP
The \s-1RC\s0 file location can also be specified with the \f(CW\*(C`DATAPRINTERRC\*(C'\fR
environment variable. Using \f(CW\*(C`rc_file\*(C'\fR in code will override the environment
variable.
.SS "\s-1RC\s0 File Security"
.IX Subsection "RC File Security"
The \f(CW\*(C`.dataprinter\*(C'\fR \s-1RC\s0 file is nothing but a Perl hash that
gets \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR'd back into the code. This means that whatever
is in your \s-1RC\s0 file \fB\s-1WILL\s0 \s-1BE\s0 \s-1INTERPRETED\s0 \s-1BY\s0 \s-1PERL\s0 \s-1AT\s0 \s-1RUNTIME\s0\fR.
This can be quite worrying if you're not the one in control
of the \s-1RC\s0 file.
.PP
For this reason, Data::Printer takes extra precaution before
loading the file:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file has to be in your home directory unless you
specifically point elsewhere via the '\f(CW\*(C`rc_file\*(C'\fR' property or
the \s-1DATAPRINTERRC\s0 environment variable;
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file \fBmust\fR be a plain file, never a symbolic
link, named pipe or socket;
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file \fBmust\fR be owned by you (i.e. the effective
user id that ran the script using Data::Printer);
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file \fBmust\fR be read-only for everyone but your user.
This usually means permissions \f(CW0644\fR, \f(CW0640\fR or \f(CW0600\fR in
Unix-like systems. \fB\s-1THIS\s0 \s-1IS\s0 \s-1NOT\s0 \s-1CHECKED\s0 \s-1IN\s0 \s-1WIN32\s0\fR;
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file will \fB\s-1NOT\s0\fR be loaded in Taint mode, unless
you specifically load Data::Printer with the 'allow_tainted'
option set to true. And even if you do that, Data::Printer
will still issue a warning before loading the file. But
seriously, don't do that.
.PP
Failure to comply with the security rules above will result in
the \s-1RC\s0 file not being loaded (likely with a warning on what went
wrong).

.el .SH "THE ``DDP'' PACKAGE ALIAS"
.IX Header "THE DDP PACKAGE ALIAS"
You're likely to add/remove Data::Printer from source code being
developed and debugged all the time, and typing it might feel too
long. Because of this, the '\s-1DDP\s0' package is provided as a shorter

.PP
.Vb 2
\&   use DDP;
\&   p %some_var;
.Ve
.SH "CALLER INFORMATION"
.IX Header "CALLER INFORMATION"
If you set caller_info to a true value, Data::Printer will prepend
every call with an informational message. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Printer caller_info => 1;
\&
\&  my $var = 42;
\&  p $var;
.Ve
.PP
will output something like:
.PP
.Vb 2

\&  42
.Ve
.PP
The default message is \f(CW\*(AqPrinting in line _\|_LINE_\|_ of _\|_FILENAME_\|_:\*(Aq\fR.
The special strings \f(CW\*(C`_\|_LINE_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_FILENAME_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_PACKAGE_\|_\*(C'\fR will
be interpolated into their according value so you can customize them at will:
.PP

\&  use Data::Printer
\&    caller_info => 1,
\&    caller_message => "Okay, _\|_PACKAGE_\|_, let\*(Aqs dance!"
\&    color => {

As of Data::Printer 0.11, you can create complex filters as a separate

See Data::Printer::Filter for further information.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
You can't pass more than one variable at a time.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   p($foo, $bar); # wrong
\&   p($foo);       # right
\&   p($bar);       # right
.Ve
.PP
The default mode is to use prototypes, in which you are supposed to pass
variables, not anonymous structures:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   p( { foo => \*(Aqbar\*(Aq } ); # wrong
\&
\&   p %somehash;        # right
\&   p $hash_ref;        # also right
.Ve
.PP
To pass anonymous structures, set \*(L"use_prototypes\*(R" option to 0. But
remember you'll have to pass your variables as references:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use Data::Printer use_prototypes => 0;
\&
\&   p( { foo => \*(Aqbar\*(Aq } ); # was wrong, now is right.
\&
\&   p( %foo  ); # was right, but fails without prototypes
\&   p( \e%foo ); # do this instead
.Ve
.PP
If you are using inline filters, and calling p() (or whatever name you
aliased it to) from inside those filters, you \fBmust\fR pass the arguments
to \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR as a reference:
.PP
.Vb 12
\&  use Data::Printer {
\&      filters => {
\&          ARRAY => sub {
\&              my $listref = shift;
\&              my $string = \*(Aq\*(Aq;
\&              foreach my $item (@$listref) {
\&                  $string .= p( \e$item );      # p( $item ) will not work!
\&              }
\&              return $string;
\&          },
\&      },
\&  };
.Ve
.PP
This happens because your filter function is compiled \fIbefore\fR Data::Printer
itself loads, so the filter does not see the function prototype. As a way
to avoid unpleasant surprises, if you forget to pass a reference, Data::Printer
will generate an exception for you with the following message:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \*(AqWhen calling p() without prototypes, please pass arguments as references\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Another way to avoid this is to use the much more complete Data::Printer::Filter
interface for standalone filters.
.SH "EXTRA TIPS"
.IX Header "EXTRA TIPS"
.SS "Circumventing prototypes"
.IX Subsection "Circumventing prototypes"
The \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR function uses prototypes by default, allowing you to say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  p %var;
.Ve
.PP
instead of always having to pass references, like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  p \e%var;
.Ve
.PP
There are cases, however, where you may want to pass anonymous
structures, like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  p { foo => $bar };   # this blows up, don\*(Aqt use
.Ve
.PP
and because of prototypes, you can't. If this is your case, just
set \*(L"use_prototypes\*(R" option to 0. Note, with this option,
you \fBwill\fR have to pass your variables as references:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use Data::Printer use_prototypes => 0;
\&
\&   p { foo => \*(Aqbar\*(Aq }; # doesn\*(Aqt blow up anymore, works just fine.
\&
\&   p %var;  # but now this blows up...
\&   p \e%var; # ...so do this instead
\&
\&   p [ $foo, $bar, \e@baz ]; # this way you can even pass
\&                            # several variables at once
.Ve
.PP
Versions prior to 0.17 don't have the \*(L"use_prototypes\*(R" option. If
you're stuck in an older version you can write \f(CW\*(C`&p()\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR
to circumvent prototypes and pass elements (including anonymous variables)
as \fB\s-1REFERENCES\s0\fR. This notation, however, requires enclosing parentheses:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  &p( { foo => $bar } );        # this is ok, use at will
\&  &p( \e"DEBUGGING THIS BIT" );  # this works too
.Ve
.PP
Or you could just create a very simple wrapper function:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sub pp { p @_ };
.Ve
.PP
And use it just as you use \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Minding the return value of p()"
.IX Subsection "Minding the return value of p()"
\&\fI(contributed by Matt S. Trout (mst))\fR
.PP
There is a reason why explicit return statements are recommended unless
you know what you're doing. By default, Data::Printer's return value
depends on how it was called. When not in void context, it returns the
serialized form of the dump.
.PP
It's tempting to trust your own p() calls with that approach, but if
this is your \fIlast\fR statement in a function, you should keep in mind
your debugging code will behave differently depending on how your
function was called!
.PP
To prevent that, set the \f(CW\*(C`return_value\*(C'\fR property to either 'void'
or 'pass'. You won't be able to retrieve the dumped string but, hey,
who does that anyway :)
.PP
Assuming you have set the pass-through ('pass') property in your
\&\f(CW\*(C`.dataprinter\*(C'\fR file, another stunningly useful thing you can do with it
is change code that says:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   return $obj\->foo;
.Ve
.PP
with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   use DDP;
\&
\&   return p $obj\->foo;
.Ve
.PP
You can even add it to chained calls if you wish to see the dump of
a particular state, changing this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $obj\->foo\->bar\->baz;
.Ve
.PP
to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $obj\->foo\->DDP::p\->bar\->baz
.Ve
.PP
And things will \*(L"Just Work\*(R".

While debugging your software, you may want to use Data::Printer in

Then call your program like:
.PP

With DB::Pluggable, you can easily set the perl debugger to use
Data::Printer to print variable information, replacing the debugger's

Then call the perl debugger as you normally would:
.PP

Now Data::Printer's \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR command will be used instead of the debugger's!
.PP
See perldebug for more information on how to use the perl debugger, and
DB::Pluggable for extra functionality and other plugins.
.PP
If you can't or don't wish to use DB::Pluggable, or simply want to keep
the debugger's \f(CW\*(C`p()\*(C'\fR function and add an extended version using
Data::Printer (let's call it \f(CW\*(C`px()\*(C'\fR for instance), you can add these

Sometimes, you may want to take advantage of Data::Printer's original dump,
but add/change some of the original data to enhance your debugging ability.
Say, for example, you have an \f(CW\*(C`HTTP::Response\*(C'\fR object you want to print
but the content is encoded. The basic approach, of course, would be to
just dump the decoded content:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  use DDP filter {
\&    \*(AqHTTP::Response\*(Aq => sub { p( \eshift\->decoded_content, %{shift} );
\&  };
.Ve
.PP
But what if you want to see the rest of the original object? Dumping it
would be a no-go, because you would just recurse forever in your own filter.
.PP
Never fear! When you create a filter in Data::Printer, you're not replacing
the original one, you're just stacking yours on top of it. To forward your data
to the original filter, all you have to do is return an undefined value. This
means you can rewrite your \f(CW\*(C`HTTP::Response\*(C'\fR filter like so, if you want:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  use DDP filters => {
\&    \*(AqHTTP::Response\*(Aq => sub {
\&      my ($res, $p) = @_;
\&
\&      # been here before? Switch to original handler
\&      return if exists $res\->{decoded_content};
\&
\&      # first timer? Come on in!
\&      my $clone = $res\->clone;
\&      $clone\->{decoded_content} = $clone\->decoded_content;
\&      return p($clone, %$p);
\&    }
\&  };
